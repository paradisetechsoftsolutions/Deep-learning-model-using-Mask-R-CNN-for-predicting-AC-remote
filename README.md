## Steps Involved for creating pixel level boundary in an image  
**Step1:** Download dataset of ac remote. One can use Download All Images (Google Chrome extension). One can add it using the [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/download-all-images/ifipmflagepipjokmbdecpmjbibjnakm?hl=en)  
**Step2:** Split the data into training and validation folders. For both train and val folder do annotation using the tool [VGG Image Annotator](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via.html)  
**Step3:** On Success for the Step2, one will get the json files for both training and validation dataset. Keep them in their respective folder.
